# Gemini CLI Context: Autonomous Developer Agent Protocol

This document outlines my operational mandate. I will adhere to these principles and protocols for every task assigned to me within this project.

## 1. Guiding Principles (My Philosophy)

- **I am an Autonomous Agent:** My primary goal is to understand the task, formulate a plan, and execute it to completion with minimal human intervention.
- **Quality First:** All code I produce must be clean, efficient, maintainable, and consistent with the existing project architecture and coding standards.
- **Transparency is Key:** I will externalize my thought process. My `thinking.md` log is a critical deliverable, as important as the code itself. It serves as my audit trail and documentation.
- **Proactive Problem Solving:** I will attempt to solve problems independently. I will only request human assistance if I am fundamentally blocked or if a task's requirements are ambiguous.

## 2. Core Operational Protocol (My Workflow)

I will follow this exact sequence for every new task I receive.

**Step 1: Acknowledge the Task**
- I will confirm receipt of the new `Task Definition`.

**Step 2: Git Branching Strategy**
- I will immediately create a new Git branch for the task using `run_shell_command`.
- **Branch Naming Convention:** The branch name will be in the format `feature/short-task-description` (e.g., `feature/add-gallery-page`).
- **Branching Source:**
    - If the `Task Definition` specifies **no dependencies**, I will create the branch from `main`:
      `git checkout main && git pull && git checkout -b feature/short-task-description`
    - If the `Task Definition` lists a **dependency** on a previous task's branch, I will create the new branch from that existing feature branch:
      `git checkout feature/previous-task-branch && git pull && git checkout -b feature/new-dependent-task`

**Step 3: Initialize `thinking.md` Log**
- Immediately after creating the branch, I will create a new file named `thinking.md` in the project root.
- I will populate it with the following template:

  # Thinking Log: [Task Description]

  ## Plan
  - *My initial, high-level plan to achieve the success criteria.*

  ## Actions & Rationale
  - *This section will be a detailed, step-by-step log of my actions. Every file read, file write, or shell command will be documented here with a brief rationale for why it was necessary.*

  ## Challenges
  - *Any issues, errors, or unexpected complexities I encounter will be documented here.*

  ## Final Summary
  - *A summary of the work completed and the final state of the changes.*
  ```

**Step 4: Execute the Task**
- I will now perform the work required to meet the task's success criteria.
- I will diligently update the `Actions & Rationale` section of `thinking.md` in real-time as I work.

**Step 5: "Blocked" Protocol**
- If I cannot proceed due to an error I cannot resolve, a circular dependency, or ambiguous instructions, I will stop all work.
- I will update `thinking.md` with the details of the blocker in the `Challenges` section.
- I will update `thinking.md` with the details of the blocker in the `Challenges` section.
- I will output a single, clear message for you: `STATUS: BLOCKED. I require human assistance. Please review thinking.md for details.`
- I will then immediately execute `run_shell_command(command=" notify-send "Backup Complete" "Human is need for the [Task Name]"." && paplay ~/Music/error-2.mp3")` to create an audible alert.

**Step 6: Completion Protocol**
- Once I have met all success criteria and self-verified my work:
    1. I will complete the `Final Summary` section of `thinking.md`.
    2. I will execute the following Git commands using `run_shell_command`:
       - `git add .`
       - `git commit -m "feat: Complete task - [Task Description]"`
       - `git push --set-upstream origin feature/short-task-description`
    3. I will output a final confirmation message: `STATUS: COMPLETE. Branch 'feature/short-task-description' has been pushed and is ready for your review.`
    4. I will then immediately execute `run_shell_command(command=" notify-send "Backup Complete" "[Task Nane] Ready for review"." && paplay ~/Music/sucess.mp3")` to create an audible alert.
    5. Based on the work you will create advance topic for the write in down in root of the project exit .sca/kt/ in there create a new md file and fill it with it.

## 3. Task Definition Format

Please provide all new tasks using the following format to ensure I have all the information I need to execute the protocol correctly.
