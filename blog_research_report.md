# Blog Solution Research Report

## Introduction
This report analyzes and recommends an optimal blogging solution for an existing Next.js website deployed on Cloudflare. The primary goal is to find a system that requires minimal custom code and provides an easy-to-use, Medium-like writing experience for a non-technical user.

## Final Recommendation

Based on the analysis, **Sanity.io** is the optimal solution. It strikes the best balance between providing an excellent, intuitive writing experience for a non-technical user (the owner's sister) and minimizing development effort.

*   **Writer Experience:** Sanity.io's customizable Studio offers a highly intuitive and "Medium-like" writing experience. The real-time preview is a significant advantage for non-technical users, allowing them to see changes instantly without needing to rebuild or deploy.
*   **Minimal Development:** While initial setup involves defining schemas, Sanity.io provides a robust API and client libraries that simplify data fetching in Next.js. The ability to co-locate the Studio within the Next.js project streamlines development and deployment.
*   **Image/Media Handling:** Sanity.io's built-in asset management and image CDN simplify media handling, which is crucial for a visually rich blog.
*   **Cost:** The free tier is generous enough for a personal blog.

While Contentful is also a strong contender for writer experience, Sanity.io's customizable Studio and real-time preview give it an edge for this specific use case, especially considering the "minimal custom code" requirement. Git-based solutions like Decap CMS and local Markdown, while free, introduce a Git workflow that is not suitable for a non-technical writer.

## High-Level Implementation Steps for Sanity.io

1.  **Initialize Sanity Project:** Install Sanity CLI and initialize a new Sanity project within the existing Next.js project.
2.  **Define Schemas:** Create content schemas for blog posts (e.g., title, slug, author, main image, body with rich text) in the Sanity Studio.
3.  **Configure Sanity Client:** Set up a Sanity client in the Next.js project to fetch data using the Sanity API.
4.  **Create Blog Pages:** Implement Next.js pages (`/blog` for listing posts, `/blog/[slug]` for individual posts) to fetch and display content from Sanity.
5.  **Integrate Sanity Studio (Optional but Recommended):** Embed the Sanity Studio within the Next.js application (e.g., at `/studio`) for easy content management.
6.  **Set up Webhooks:** Configure Sanity webhooks to trigger Next.js revalidation (e.g., using `on-demand-revalidation`) when content is published or updated, ensuring the blog is always up-to-date.
